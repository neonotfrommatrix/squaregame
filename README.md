Metal Gear Square: Mario

This is a basic JavaScript game using the new HTML element, canvas.
The game works by pressing the keys to move around the canvas.
The objective is to get the pixel player into the square base!

Press "a" to move right, press "s" to move down, press "w" to move up, and press "d" to move left.

Enjoy!
